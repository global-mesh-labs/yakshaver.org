title: "Using Bitcoin In Hostile Environments"

## Proposal

We will create a research report focused on technologies that facilitate the use of Bitcoin in hostile environments. Our focus will be on the challenges faced by Bitcoin users outside of wealthy developed economies with stable liberal governments. Specifically, users with unreliable and/or expensive telecommunication and power infrastructure living in jurisdictions where Bitcoin has poor legal protection or is subject to arbitrary enforcement by potentially corrupt authorities. We will examine the trade-offs between custodial and non-custodial solutions in this context and the challenges faced by a population with much fewer economic resources than most Bitcoin users in developed economies.

Our report will survey existing Bitcoin technologies in the context of different hostile environments. In particular to see how they might be used in economically impoverished communities and to overcome poor infrastructure and Internet censorship. Our survey will include existing and future mobile Bitcoin and Lightning wallets, geostationary and low-earth orbit satellites, amateur and mesh radio systems and familiar messaging technologies like Telegram and Whatsapp.

We will conduct online interviews with our target Bitcoin users to identify issues with existing solutions in their context. The goal of this project will be specific recommendations for Bitcoin developers working on tools for communities living in hostile environments.

This project will be developed as an open source online report that can be dicussed and added to by the community both before and after its initial release.
