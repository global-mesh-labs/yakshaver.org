See below for a beta demo of **Fiat Trader** happy path and unhappy path trades.
  
The happy path is when the seller correctly delivers the sold fiat currency to the buyer and the buyer correctly acknowledges receipt of the fiat currency and releases the escrowed bitcoin used to buy the fiat currency to the seller. On releasing the bitcoin to the seller both buyer and seller are also refunded for their unused trade bonds and arbitrator fees.

The unhappy path is when the seller does NOT delivers the sold fiat currency to the buyer or the buyer does NOT correctly acknowledges receipt of the fiat currency. In this scenario the buyer or seller requests that the arbitrator review evidence that the fiat currency was delivered or not. Based on what the arbitrator finds either the trade goes through and the seller receives their bitcoin payment (plus the buyers bond/deposit amount).  Or the buyer is refunded their escrowed bitcoin (plus the sellers bond/deposit). The losing party in each case must also pay the arbitrator fee.
