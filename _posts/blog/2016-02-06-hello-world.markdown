We are pleased to announce the **Bytabit Fiat Trader** project and to make public our current prototype code. We are currently heads down focused on coding and may not post updates here as often as we would like. But please check out our <a href="https://bitbucket.org/bytabit/fiat-trader" target="_blank">Bitbucket repository</a> to see our most recent work. Once our alpha release is ready for testing we will post all the details.
